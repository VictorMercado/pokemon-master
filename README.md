# Pokemon-master
The goal of this project is to create a Pokemon battle game where players can compete against an AI opponent. The game will simulate the core mechanics of the Pokemon franchise, including choosing a team of Pokemon, battling with moves and abilities, and determining a winner based on the remaining Pokemon's health.
